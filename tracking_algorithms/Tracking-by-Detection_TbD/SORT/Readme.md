## 🧠 SORT-based Person Tracking
File: SORT.py

- This script implements multi-person tracking using the classic SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) algorithm developed by `Alex Bewley`(https://github.com/abewley/sort) [Alex_Bewley_SORT.py](./Alex_Bewley_SORT.py). 

- It integrates YOLOv8 (for person detection) with SORT (for motion-based tracking) to perform efficient online tracking of multiple people in video sequences.

**SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) is extremely lightweight:**

- It only uses a Kalman Filter + IoU matching.
- No deep learning, no embeddings.
- It just updates track states from detections.

## 🧩 Algorithm Workflow

**1. YOLOv8 Detection**
   - Each video frame is passed through the YOLOv8 model.
   - Bounding boxes for the "person" class are extracted.

**2. SORT Tracking**
   - Detections are passed to the SORT tracker.
   - SORT maintains unique track IDs using a Kalman Filter and IoU-based data association.
   - Tracks are updated frame-by-frame in real time.

**3. Visualization & Output**
   - Each detected and tracked person is shown with a bounding box and unique ID.
   - A processed video file is saved showing tracked movements.

## ⚙️ Dependencies

Install the following packages before running:

``pip install ultralytics``

``pip install opencv-python``

``pip install numpy``

``pip install filterpy``

Note: Alex_Bewley_SORT.py uses filterpy for Kalman filtering.  
Ensure the file name is exactly "Alex_Bewley_SORT.py" (no spaces).

            └── Alex_Bewley_SORT.py - Original SORT implementation (by Alex Bewley)

**2. Running the Tracker**

To run SORT tracking on a video:
```bash
python SORT.py
```
**3. Parameters**

Parameter       | Description                                                    | Default
----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------

## 🧾 Example Output

### 📹 **Video Information**
| Property | Value |
|-----------|--------|
| **Resolution** | 640 × 360 |
| **FPS** | 29 |
| **Total Frames** | 3493 |
| **Tracker** | SORT ([Alex Bewley](https://github.com/abewley/sort)) |


### ⚙️ **Performance Summary**

| Metric | Description | Value |
|:--------|:-------------|:-------:|
| **Avg YOLO FPS** | Speed of detection (object inference rate) | **12.97** |
| **Avg SORT FPS** | Speed of data association (tracker update rate) | **342.34** |
| **Avg Total FPS** | True end-to-end video processing rate | **11.06** |
| **Total Frames** | Total processed frames | **3493** |
| **Total Time** | Overall runtime | **322.10 sec** |
| **Unique Persons Tracked** | Distinct tracked IDs | **767** |

> 💡 **Note:** The high `SORT FPS` is expected — SORT performs only lightweight Kalman filtering and IOU-based matching, which is much faster than DeepSORT.


### ✅ **Output Details**
- 🧍 Bounding boxes drawn around detected persons  
- 🏷️ Labels displayed as `Person | ID:<id>`  
- 💾 Processed video automatically saved as  
  **`Sample_Video_Tracked_SORT.mp4`**

### 🧠 **Interpretation**
- **Avg YOLO FPS** → Model inference speed (bottleneck for real-time tracking)  
- **Avg SORT FPS** → Tracker’s internal speed, excluding detection  
- **Avg Total FPS** → Combined YOLO + SORT performance (realistic frame rate)
